            <p>
                Comcraft Mod Loader enables mods to be loaded into the game. Mods are downloaded as <code>.mod</code>
                files and placed into the <code>comcraft/mods</code> directory on your phone.<br> Multiple mods can be
                installed at once and you don't need to re-install the game at any time (except for mod loader updates).<br>
                <br> Mods are developed using a special IDE, you can grab a copy from the <a href="downloads/">downloads page</a>.
                <br> Please see the wiki (link above) for information on developing mods.<br>
                <br> You can read the blog post on the Comcraft blog 
                <a href="http://comcraft-game.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/comcraft-mod-loader.html">Here</a>

                <h4>Notice</h4>
                In later versions of comcraft (from 0.5 onwards), old low-end devices will struggle to run the game as 
                multiplayer becomes available. Even if you do not intend on playing multiplayer, there will be notable
                performance drops mainly from RAM purely because a whole chunk of code is loaded even if not used. If many 
                people have problems with this I will try to make two streams - one with multiplayer and one without.
